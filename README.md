This project is still in development and is only the front-end part.
The project is made using React with JavaScript (please look at the master branch).

The game will consist of 6 levels with 3 stages each, which are
1. Level 1: Introduction to fraction
2. Level 2: Comparing unit and like fraction
3. Level 3: Addition and subtraction of fractions with the same denominator
4. Level 4: Fraction simplification
5. Level 5: Comparing unlike fraction

Main page can be seen in App.jsx and consist of routing to all pages.

Level selection can be seen in Level 1 - 6 and the game itself can be seen on L11, L12, until L63.

On stage 3 for each level, the game will be used as a data collection where user answer 25 questions and we will collect the data, which are
